# Transaction Analysis & Graph Visualization
The goal of this project is to identify top potential New to Banks based on their frequency, amount, and the number of existing customers that they transacted with.
Initial data cleansing and preparation is done using Python and some manual adjustment with excel. The final result is then visualized using visnetwork in R. Other than that leads are generated and saved in MS Excel for distribution.
This repo contains all the scripts used and also the visualization result. The data is omitted for obvious reason.
